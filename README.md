# Spam-Classifier
This is a NLP Use case in which I have performed a Spam Classifier Problem using a UCI REPOSITORY dataset.
In this use case there are few NLP techniques performed which are listed below:

1:Stemming
2:Stop Words
3:Bag Of Words(Vectors)
4:Train Test Split for training and test
4:Model training using NaiveBayes Classifier

Except the above techniques, alternatively we can use other techniques as well such as :
1.Lemmatization
2.TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
3.Classfication Algorithms
